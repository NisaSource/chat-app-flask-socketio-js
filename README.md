# CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

### Project 2

In this project, I built an online messaging service using Flask. Users are able to sign into the site with a display name, create channels (i.e. chatrooms) to communicate in, as well as see and join existing channels. Once a channel is selected, users will be able to send and receive messages with one another in real time.
